            Positive Contributions of Artificial Intelligence to Society
        </h1>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that require human intelligence. AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of society, from healthcare to transportation to entertainment. Here are some of the positive contributions of AI to society:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Healthcare:</strong> AI has the potential to transform healthcare by improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools can help doctors identify diseases more accurately and quickly, leading to better outcomes for patients.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Transportation:</strong> AI is being used to improve transportation systems, making them safer, more efficient, and more sustainable. For example, self-driving cars can reduce accidents and traffic congestion, while AI-powered traffic management systems can optimize traffic flow.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Entertainment:</strong> AI is being used to create new forms of entertainment, such as virtual reality and augmented reality experiences. AI-powered algorithms can also personalize content recommendations, making it easier for people to discover new music, movies, and TV shows.
            </li>
        </ul>

            But how does AI work?
        </h2>
        <p>
            AI systems are typically built using machine learning algorithms, which enable them to learn from data and improve their performance over time. These algorithms can be trained on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions. For example, a machine learning model could be trained on thousands of images of cats and dogs to learn how to distinguish between the two animals.
        </p>
        <p>    
            These algorithms are typically based on neural networks. Neural networks are a type of AI model that is inspired by the structure of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," that process and transmit information. By adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons, neural networks can learn to perform specific tasks, such as image recognition or natural language processing.
        </p>
        <p>    
            To train these networks, data scientists use a process called backpropagation, which involves feeding the network input data, comparing its output to the desired output, and adjusting the weights of the connections to minimize the error. This process is repeated many times until the network can accurately perform the task it was trained to do.
        </p>
        <p>    
            But how does the network know how much to change its weights by? This is where the concept of a loss function comes in. A loss function is a mathematical function that measures how well the network is performing on a given task. By calculating the loss, the network can determine how much it needs to adjust its weights to improve its performance.
