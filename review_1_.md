Review:

(i) Interest of content
The content of this website is fascinating. I feel more informed on both communication and artificial intelligence!

(ii) Consistency and quality of visual presentation
Visually, the website is stunning. They have brilliantly combined images and text to create a complete and stylistic website.

(iii) Quality of written presentation
The text is of suitable size and colour, making it easily readable for all. Despite this, on mobile formats it could use some updating. 

(iv) Validity of HTML
HTML is very valid and is clearly masterfully and painstakingly crafted by experts. 

However, some images are missing an "alt" attribute, which may make the website less accessible for some users.
The documents should begin with <!Doctype HTML>
There is one rogue </p> without a corresponding <p>. 

(v) Evidence of collaboration including
After in depth analysis of the commit history, it is abundantly evident that all of the author messages are written by contrasing authors.
Moreover, the mean number of commits to the project was 10, with a standar deviation of ~2.5.
All contributors were within 2 standard deviations of the mean, making it reasonable to conclude that all contributers were equally involved
in the project. 

Overall, I think this project deserves a 10/10.
